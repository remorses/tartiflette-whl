# [0.12.1] - 2019-07-17

## Changed

- Update pytest from 5.0.0 to 5.0.1

## Fixed

- [ISSUE-263](https://github.com/dailymotion/tartiflette/issues/263) - Now variables typed as `[any!]` are correctly validated
  >Note that this is a non complete fix, `[[[any!]]!]` like type will fail validation (but who uses this ?) it will be completly fixed in 1.0.0 with the completly rewrote parsing/validation/execution algo, stay tuned :p
