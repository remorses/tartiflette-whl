We are going to use what [we developed in the previous step](./write-your-mutation-resolvers.md).

Do not forget to use the embedded GraphiQL client, available at this address [http://localhost:8080/graphiql](http://localhost:8080/graphiql) when your server is running.

## Update the name and cooking time

Copy/paste this GraphQL request to your GraphiQL instance and execute it:
```graphql
mutation {
  updateRecipe(input: {
    id: 1
    name: "The best Tartiflette by Eric Guelpa"
    cookingTime: 12
  }) {
    id
    name
    cookingTime
  }
}
```
